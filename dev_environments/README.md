# Dev Environments

The goal here is: 
* To have a single line that will instantiate your machine with:
    * An IDE
    * A starter project 
    * A test framework
    * A passing/failing test 
    * The ability to run the test from the IDE

**Note** All goals may not be met, currently

# Process

1. Many of these scripts were created with the help of Exercism  
   * Sign up for the track on [Exercism](https://exercism.io/my/tracks) and Practice Mode
   * Select "Hello World" and click the "Download" button on the right of the screen.
   * Paste that into your command line
   * On the right, a little further down, click on "√ènstalling <language>"
   * Follow instructions for Windows installation (or check Chocolatey for a package)
   * Open Intellij and Import Project (click next on all the pop-ups)
   * Open the Hello World project and look for a test file and open it.
   * Look for the "Running the Tests" link and click on that to get instructions for running tests
